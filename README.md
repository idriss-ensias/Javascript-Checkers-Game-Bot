Small checkers javascript canvas game with a built in bot using a game tree
## Checkers Game
Simple Checkers Game developped using Javascript with no frameworks, i added a bot that relies on a game tree (moves with the most "eats" are chosen), you can set the depth of the tree in file 'checkersGameArea.js' line 106. Just keep in mind that the more levels you add more computation is needed, so it will take more time for the bot to make a move.
## Future improvements
I intend on making the bot faster, by making a few changes in the game logic. Please take a look at my game and let me know what you think, especially on how i implemented the game tree logic. Do not hesitate on contacting me at idriss.el.moussaouiti@gmail.com to share with me ideas or recommandations.
